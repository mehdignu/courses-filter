The clashing paradigms of globalization and\/versus sovereignty as well as regionalization and\/versus globalization will be identified and critically discussed.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Educational Goals:<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You will be familiarized with the theoretical premises and conceptual approaches to globalization and learn the main causes, history and basic definitions.<\/li>\r\n<li>You will get the opportunity to link your theoretical knowledge to practical tasks concerning real-world situations from East European countries and discuss your point of view with other participants.<\/li>\r\n<li>You will be provided with practical skills concerning presenting and defending your own statements as well as elaborating your arguments and a well-structured research paper.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Assessment:<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Completing three Discussion Board Tasks concerning posting a paper to the Discussion Board dealing with theoretical and practical topics on the globalization and its impact on Eastern Europe as well as reacting to posts of your fellow students.<\/li>\r\n<li>Creating your own research on the topic of the global role of a specific organization in the context of globalization.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",
